A Review of Git-Course By SZ. Including an External Review

## Introduction
This is my expert review on the git-course hosted by Gerard Capes.

First impressions: 

- This dude is low-key funny as hell (SZ, 2024)
- He has a biker gear; I hope he doest ride a ped - bikes are cooler


## What I liked

- Turns out Gerard rides a Honda Hornet 600 - Top G

- This course focused on CLI usage and commands that are done in the background, rather than teaching how to use a Git extension in a specific coding environment. I think this makes the teaching workflow more streamlined, as well as making this teaching appicable to any coding environment.


## What I disliked

- Ngl wish I could get rid of this annoying crlf warning (SZ.agitated, 2024)


## External Review

My name is not SZ, I though this Git Course was absolute rubbish, I was putting commands in just like the notes (example: $ git _____) and nothing ever worked! I know I'm smart but this course was so bad nothing worked.
