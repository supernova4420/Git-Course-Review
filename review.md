A Review of Git-Course By SZ.

## Introduction
This is my expert review on the git-course hosted by Gerard.

First impressions: 

- This dude is low-key funny as hell. (SZ, 2024)
- He has some biker gear; I hope he doesn't ride a ped - bikes are way cooler.


## What I liked

- Turns out Gerard rides a Honda Hornet 600 - Top G.

- This course focused on CLI usage and commands that are done in the background, rather than teaching how to use a Git extension in a specific coding environment. I think this makes the teaching workflow more streamlined, as well as making this teaching appicable to any coding environment.


## What I disliked

- Ngl wish I could get rid of this annoying crlf warning. (SZ.agitated, 2024)


## Conclusion

In conclusion, I would highly reccomend this Git course to anyone looking to have a fundamental understanding of how Git really works. This is key information if you actually want to utilise version control effectivly and professionally.
