A Review of Git-Course By SZ

# Introduction
This is my expert review on the git-course hosted by Gerard Capes.

First impressions: 

- This dude is low-key funny as hell (SZ, 2024)

# What I liked

- This course focused on CLI usage and commands that are done in the background, rather than teaching how to use a Git extension in a specific coding environment. I think this makes the teaching workflow more streamlined, as well as making this teaching appicable to any coding environment.



# What I disliked

- Ngl wish I could get rid of this annoying crlf warning (SZ.agitated, 2024)
